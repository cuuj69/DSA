#Utopian Tree
Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year.

By the question 

The tree goes throug 2 cycles of growth every year, 

Each spring  == height x 2
Each summer  == height + 1

n = 5

sample input

0
1
4

sample output

1
2
7

0 n=0 the initial height of the tree remains the same (H =1) after the cycle the height is 1
1 the height of the tree doubles (n=1 h=2) after the cycle the height is 2
2 the height of the doubles after the first cycle (n=1 h=2) then during the summer the tree adds one meter of height (n=2 h=3) after the cycle the height is 3
3 the height of the tree doubles after the first cycle (n1 = h2) then during the summer the tree adds one meter of height (n=2 h=3)the during the next spring the tree doubles in height (n=3 h=6) after the cycle the height is 6
4 the height of the tree doubles in the spring(n=1 h=2) then adds one meter of height in the summer (n=2 h=3) then during the next spring the tree doubles in height (n=3 h=6) then in the next summer the tree adds one meter of height (n=4 h=7)after the cycle the height is 7
5 the height of the tree doubles in the spring(n=1 h=2) then adds one meter of height in the summer (n=2 h=3) then during the next spring the tree doubles in height in the next spring( n=3 h=6) then adds one meter in the summer(n=4 h=7)then in the next spring the tree doubles in height
(n=5 h=14)


function utopianTree(n) {
    // Write your code here
    let spring = 2;
    let summer = 1;
    let height = 1;
    let cycle = n;
    if(n < 1){
        return 1;
    }
    else{        
        while(cycle !== 0){
            height *= spring;
            cycle -=1;
            if(cycle < 1){
                break;
            }
            height += summer
            cycle -=1  
        }       
    } 
    return height;
}
